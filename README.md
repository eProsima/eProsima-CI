# eProsima-CI

This is a github CI auxiliary repo that contains common github steps, actions, and workflows shared along multiple eProsima libraries and tools.
The main idea is to collect every repeated or generic step of any CI to have a single more maintainable generic point.

## User manual

In order to use this repository, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. **Always use a fix version**.
   When using any of these actions, set it with a `@v<X>` version.
2. Use `multiplatform` actions when possible.
   They automatically will redirect the action to the proper OS.
3. If planning a long well preserved CI, use `@vX.Y` versioning, to be sure that CI will not change and break something in the future.
   However, this may be a problem because it will not be updated with improvements or external versions.
4. Actions are documented in their own `<platform>/<action_name>/action.yml` files.
   Check each file for description and argument definitions.

For more information about versioning handle of this project, check following [file](.dev/versioning_guidelines.md).

## Workflows

There are several workflows implemented that build projects and upload them as artifacts.
These are used for other projects to speed up the build process of the dependencies.

### Artifacts uploaded

So far, the following workflows are running to upload artifacts:

- [Fast DDS](<https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS>)
- [dev-utils](<https://github.com/eProsima/dev-utils>)
- [DDS Pipe](<https://github.com/eProsima/DDS-Pipe/>)

These are the artifacts that are generated every night with the latest versions of each project:

- Fast DDS
  - build_fastdds_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-22.04_Debug_nightly
  - build_fastdds_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-22.04_Release_nightly
  - build_fastdds_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-24.04_Debug_nightly
  - build_fastdds_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-24.04_Release_nightly
  - build_fastdds_<fastdds-version>_windows-2019_Debug_nightly
  - build_fastdds_<fastdds-version>_windows-2019_Release_nightly
  - build_fastdds_<fastdds-version>_windows-2022_Debug_nightly
  - build_fastdds_<fastdds-version>_windows-2022_Release_nightly

- dev-utils
  - build_dev_utils_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-22.04_Debug_nightly
  - build_dev_utils_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-22.04_Release_nightly
  - build_dev_utils_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-24.04_Debug_nightly
  - build_dev_utils_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-24.04_Release_nightly
  - build_dev_utils_<fastdds-version>_windows-2019_Debug_nightly
  - build_dev_utils_<fastdds-version>_windows-2019_Release_nightly
  - build_dev_utils_<fastdds-version>_windows-2022_Debug_nightly
  - build_dev_utils_<fastdds-version>_windows-2022_Release_nightly

- DDS Pipe
  - build_ddspipe_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-22.04_Debug_nightly
  - build_ddspipe_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-22.04_Release_nightly
  - build_ddspipe_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-24.04_Debug_nightly
  - build_ddspipe_<fastdds-version>_ubuntu-24.04_Release_nightly
  - build_ddspipe_<fastdds-version>_windows-2019_Debug_nightly
  - build_ddspipe_<fastdds-version>_windows-2019_Release_nightly
  - build_ddspipe_<fastdds-version>_windows-2022_Debug_nightly
  - build_ddspipe_<fastdds-version>_windows-2022_Release_nightly

In order to use one of these artifacts, use the following action as a step:

```yml
- name: Get fastdds artifact
  uses: eProsima/eProsima-CI/multiplatform/download_dependency@v0
  with:
    artifact_name: build_fastdds_ubuntu-20.04_Debug_nightly
    workflow_source: build_fastdds.yml
    workflow_source_repository: eProsima/eProsima-CI
    # Path where to download the installs from the artifact
    target_workspace: ${{ github.workspace }}/install
    # If inside an action, this value must be generated in workflow and passed as argument
    secret_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    workflow_conclusion: completed
```

#### Generate artifacts manually

The artifacts can be customized so the artifacts generated follow specific configurations.
These configurations are set in a `.repos` and `colcon.meta` files in a new branch in eProsima-CI.
In order to change the dependencies required to build within an artifact,
set [dependencies.repos](.github/workflows/configurations/<artifact>/dependencies.repos) with the new repositories to download and build.
In order to change CMake options when building the artifact, set files in files in `.github/workflows/configurations/metas`.
Run the `manual_build` workflow with these arguments:

- `build_configuration_branch`: Branch created with `.repos` and `colcon.meta` files.
- `artifacts_name_postfix`: Postfix of the name of the artifact used to download and link, and also postfix of the name of the generated artifact.

> :warning: Do not generate custom artifacts with postfix `_nightly`, as this is the main name other repos will use.

## Custom artifact generation

The workflow [manual_build](.github/workflows/manual_build.yml) supports to create any artifact giving a `.repos` and `colcon.meta` files.
In order to run this workflow, create a branch in this repository,
set [dependencies.repos](.github/workflows/configurations/manual/dependencies.repos) file with the repositories needed to build the project and set `colcon.meta` files in `.github/workflows/configurations/metas`.
Then, run the `manual_build` workflow with these arguments:

- `build_configuration_branch`: Branch created with `.repos` and `colcon.meta` files.
- `artifacts_name_prefix`: Prefix of the name of the artifact to generate.
- `artifacts_name_postfix`: Postfix of the name of the artifact to generate.

The result artifacts will be called `<artifacts_name_prefix>_<os>_<cmake_build_type><artifacts_name_postfix>`.
